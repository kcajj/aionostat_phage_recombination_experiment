we want to create a msa between assembly and references

put it in results

start with assembly 1

command:
mafft --auto data/P2C1_refs.fasta > results/C1msa.fasta

now we want to load this file in biopython and put the sequences in a numpy matrix

it worked

now we select the reads for the longest

we have the longest read, now we want to put it in a file with the references

now we produce the msa of this file

mafft --auto results/reads/P2_1_0.fasta > results/msa/P2_1_0_msa.fasta

then we process the msa with the script produced before

we need ot select for the reads in the last populations

we will execute the whole thing on 10 reads

reads=("0" "1" "2" "3" "4" "5" "6" "7" "8" "9")
for read in "${reads[@]}"
do
mafft --retree 2 --maxiterate 2 results/reads/P2/5/P2_5_$read.fasta > results/msa/P2/5/P2_5_$read_msa.fasta
done

for timepoint 5 and 7

no results, it is too slow

by using minimap we get a shitty alignment

we need another way to select reads and to align them, i think i will use the data of population alignment
